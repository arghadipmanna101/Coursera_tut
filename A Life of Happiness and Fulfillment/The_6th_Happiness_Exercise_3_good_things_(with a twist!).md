## * Project Title ##
=> 3 good things (with a twist!)

## 1. Overall, how easy or difficult was this exercise for you? Why? ##

 => The exercise was mildly easy and it took time to think but overall it was good  

 ## 2. How much more (or less) confident do you now feel that no event or outcome is “purely” positive or negative? Why (or why not)? ##

 => Actually, now I feel that no event is perfectly positive or perfectly negative, it is up to us to convert the joy and fraternity of the moment .

## 3. Typically, those who do this exercise can more spontaneously see the positive consequences triggered by negative events. Did this happen to you? (Please elaborate.) ##

 => Actually, now I feel that no event is perfectly positive or perfectly negative, it is up to us to convert the joy and fraternity of the moment .
