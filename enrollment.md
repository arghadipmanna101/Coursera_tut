##* Reason you applied for aid:-##

Hello, my name is "Your name" and I live in "District Name", the country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "Course Name" because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in "Purpose of the course" , and i searching for a job from a long time for earning money for taking this course, and i not find yet, and the time goes on, and receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and by taking it to allow to take off a paid internship and can take another course in machine learning path . I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, I'm eager to work and to advance in my career.

##* How will your selected course help with your goals? ##

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking course Version Control with Git can help me advance in my knowledge. Git as a version control tool is something I came across few times now. I really want to know as much as I can about Git because it seams it is standard programming tool nowadays. Previously I worked with version control tools like SVN and Mercurail but I think Git is the best tool for version control and I want to know and to learn about it. Git version control is best within teams also I believe, so learning about Git will help me work better in the team working environment. To be good in teamwork is one of my career goals also so learning and understanding git will help me achieve it to. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.

##* If you answered no, please help us understand why. ##

- Simple answer is that I don't have enough money to invest in my education, I can invest only my time now.
