## Peer-graded Assignment: A Tale of Two Stories: The Do-Over ##
## ---------------------------------------------------------- ##

## * Project Title ##
=> A tale of two stories

## 1) If you encounter such a situation again (your story of NOT voicing and enacting your values), what position and impact do you want to have and what are the values that guide you to that position? 

## EXAMPLE: If someone asked you to lie for them, you might want to be able to say “no” in a way that helps them to see why integrity is important in this situation. You want to do so in a way that maintains your relationship with that person, and that influences them to find an honest way to address this situation as well.

## What position do you want to take?

## If your co-worker asked you to lie to the boss for them, you might want to be able to say “no” without sacrificing your good working relationship with the co-worker.    

## What impact do you want to have?

## To help them to them understand why lying is not an appropriate or useful approach and to hopefully help them see other ways to address the issue at hand. You also want them to understand that you have their best interest in mind, as well as your own, so you may want to help them figure out a constructive and honest way to communicate their difficult message with the boss.

## What values guide you to that position?

## Honesty, compassion ##


=> It gives great realization. 

## 2) What is at risk for each of the affected parties, including yourself? ##

=> Yes it includes.

## 3)  What are three Reasons and Rationalizations you might encounter when you try to enact your values? (Revisit the lecture “GVV Pillars: Reasons & Rationalizations” for some examples of “Reasons & Rationalizations” but you may need to identify different ones, depending on the situation you are working on. ) ##

=>
1.Power

2.Self respect

3.Realization

## 4) What data do you need to gather?

## EXAMPLE: You can analyze the arguments that individuals are making to support unethical action, in order to find the flaws or the incomplete information they may be using. ##

=>
Despite good intentions, organizations set themselves up for ethical catast by creating environments in which people feel forced to make choices they never have imagined. Former Federal Prosecutor Serina Vash says, "When began prosecuting corruption, I expected to walk into rooms and find the people. I was shocked to find ordinarily good people I could well have had with that morning. And they were still good peoplewho'd made terrible. 

## 5) What is one positive and negative example can you draw upon?

## EXAMPLE: Are there examples of the positive impacts of acting ethically or the negative impacts of failing to do so that you can gather? Are there inspiring stories of ways that the organization or individuals within the organization have successfully acted on their values? ##  

=>
Identify the factors that affect stakeholder prioritization

Explain why priorities will vary based upon the interest and power of the stakeholder

Describe how to prioritize stakeholder claims, particularly when they .

## 6) Will you do this alone or will you try to enlist allies? Give at least one reason supporting the approach you have chosen. ##

=>
One such idea is that of community organization -- the idea that people car should come together to talk about what matters to them, and then work t to successfully change their communities. As this idea is a common thread throughout our work, we'd like to use this chapter to make it explicit, and t explore it more fully.

## 7) How could you respond to the Reasons & Rationalizations that you identified in Question #3? 

## EXAMPLE: If someone said that this issue was not important enough to worry about, you might counter by saying that it is often much easier to address such a situation when it is smaller, before it leads to larger and more risky situations. And then you could strengthen your position by providing an example. ##
 
=>
So often the best way torespond to him or her is not to argue that it's their responsibility, but rather to engage them in brainstorming ways that the si might be addressed effectively. Once they have some workable ideas for ar implementation plan, motivating action is likely to be easier.

## 8.   What are three levers you can use to strengthen your position? (Revisit the lecture “Levers for Influence/Impact: It Depends Where You Sit” to review) ##

=>
1.Position 

2.Strength 

3.Power
