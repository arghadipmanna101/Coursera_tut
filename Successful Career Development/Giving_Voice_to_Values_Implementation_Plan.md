## Giving Voice to Values Implementation Plan ##

## * Project Title ##
=> Target.

## YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE: ##

## 1) Whom do you want to influence to more effectively and consistently voice and enact their ethical Values? 

## If the CONTEXT you selected was “Workplace,” the Audience could refer to the level of employee ( for example, your managers? your peers? or your employees?) or the Audience could refer to the corporate department (for example, audit, finance, marketing, sales, operations, etc.) that you wish to influence.

## If the CONTEXT you selected was “Educator,” the Audience could refer to the Students in a particular course you teach or the Faculty who will design the broader curriculum.

## If the the CONTEXT you selected was “Personal,” the Audience could refer to yourself.

=> To our audience.

LEARNING GOALS:

## 2) Think about what the priority issues/concerns are for your target audience. Think about what you want the target audience to learn to do. That is, what are the issues/concerns that you want the audience to learn to handle ethically? For example, “after this training/practice, the audience will be equipped and more likely to do ______”.  List at least 2 learning goals for your target audience.

## (For example, if your selected “CONTEXT” is the “workplace,” you may want your employees to resist pressures to mislead customers about a product’s attributes while still finding ways to build productive and sustainable relationships with them. Or if your selected “CONTEXT” is “Educator” and you are an Accounting professor, you may want to design class sessions that help your Students to craft and rehearse ways to use the language and frameworks of Accounting to resist the pressure to distort internal audit reports. Or if your selected “CONTEXT” is “Personal Life,” you may want to practice intervening calmly and effectively to stop harassment when you witness disrespectful behaviors toward others. And so on. Remember that if the “CONTEXT” you selected in Part I is “Personal Use”, your audience may likely be yourself.)

.Honest

.Self respect

## CASE SCENARIO: ##

## 3) Identify and describe in a few sentences one example of a relevant and important situational scenario (or case “story”) that addresses one of your Learning Goals from Question # 2 above and raises key values challenges for your target audience.
=> Responsibility  is the main thing which a person needs

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT: Working with the scenario/story you identified in Question # 3 above, respond to questions #4-#9.

## 4) What is the Values-Based Position the Case Protagonist (the main actor in the case) wants to take? (If you are doing the GVV for Plan for Personal Use, then you are the Protagonist). ##

=> Target audience

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT: 

## 5) What is at risk for each affected party in the situation? Please address at minimum, the Protagonist and the individual(s) the protagonist is trying to influence. 

=> Individual

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT:

## 6) What are at least three predictable Reasons & Rationalization (objections) the Protagonist is likely to encounter when they act on their values?

=>
. Objective

. Rationalism

. Obedient 

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT:

## 7) What would be the most effective responses (or “scripts”) that the protagonist can use to effectively respond to the “Reasons & Rationalizations” identified in Question # 6? Name at least 2 responses to one of the “Reasons & Rationalizations” named above.

=> Reasons

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT:

## 8) What would be the most effective tactics and/or action plans that the protagonist can use to act successfully on their values? Name at least 2 tactics/action plans that you will use and be specific about how they would use them.

## (For example, do they need to “re-frame” the whole problem? (that is, perhaps instead of framing the situation as a win/lose choice, they can show how there are multiple possible options.) Or do they need to gather more data such as examples of experiences within the organization when more positive choices were successfully pursued and if so, how would they use this data? Do they need to find allies or build a coalition and if so, how would they identify and utilize these allies? And so on).

=> Target audience

## CASE SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT:

## 9) When and how will use the GVV-style scenario identified in Questions 3–8 above to develop greater “moral muscle memory” in your target audience?

## (For example, if the “CONTEXT” you selected was the “workplace,” would you develop a GVV-style training program, or integrate this GVV-style exercise into some existing leadership development or other trainings, or perhaps simply raise the example and lead discussions in your team meetings, or?? If the “CONTEXT” you selected was “educator,” would you integrate this GVV-style case exercise into one of your courses, and if so, which course and where? If the “CONTEXT” you selected was “Personal,” would you practice your responses to this GVV-style scenario with a friend or “peer coach”? And so on.)
